The materials, substances, or components undergoing transformation are either raw materials or products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration, renovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be manufacturing.\n\nThe output of a manufacturing process may be finished in the sense that it is ready for use or consumption, or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for further manufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the input used in the primary production of aluminium; primary aluminium is the input to aluminium wire drawing; aluminium wire is the input for the manufacture of fabricated wire products.\n\nManufacture of specialised components and parts of, and accessories and attachments to machinery and equipment is, as a general rule, classified in the same class as the manufacture of the machinery and equipment for which the parts and accessories are intended. Manufacture of unspecialised components and parts of machinery and equipment (for example, engines, pistons, electric motors, electrical assemblies, valves, gears, roller bearings, is classified in the appropriate class of manufacturing, without regard to the machinery and equipment in which these items may be included.\n\nMaking specialised components and accessories by moulding or extruding plastics materials is usually included in group 22.2.\n\nAssembly of the component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing.

However, the manufacture of new products from secondary raw materials is classified in manufacturing, even if these processes use waste as an input (for example, the production of silver from film waste is considered to be a manufacturing process).\n\nSpecialised maintenance and repair of industrial, commercial and similar machinery and equipment is, in general, classified in division 33. However, the repair and maintenance of computers, personal and household goods, motor vehicles and motorcycles is classified in division 95.\n\nThe installation of machinery and equipment, when carried out as a specialised activity, is classified in class 33.20.\n\nMaintenance, repair and installation of equipment that forms an integral part of buildings or similar structures (for example, maintenance, repair and installation of escalators or of air-conditioning systems, is classified as construction in section F, if carried out at the construction site). \n\nThis section also contains the activities of factoryless goods producers (FGPs) in manufacturing (see introductory guidelines, paragraph xx).\n\nAs a general rule, the activities in the manufacturing section involve the transformation of materials into new, rebuilt and remanufactured products. Their output is a new product.

Goods are physical, produced objects for which a demand exists, over which ownership rights can be established and whose ownership can be transferred from one unit to another by engaging in transactions on markets. This is consistent with the definitions and concepts applied in the balance of payments domain, the G20 Digital Economy Task Force, the Handbook on Measuring Digital Trade, and so on.\n\nWholesale and retail sale are the final steps in the distribution of merchandise. For this purpose, ancillary activities (see introductory guidelines, Chapter xx) are carried out, which include a number of usual operations (or manipulations) associated with trade, without transforming the goods. These operations (or manipulations) include, for example, sorting, grading and assembling of goods, mixing or blending of goods (for example, sand), bottling (with or without preceding bottle cleaning), packaging, breaking bulk and repacking for distribution in smaller lots, storage (whether or not frozen or chilled). If not carried out as usual operations (or manipulations) associated with trade, the mentioned activities can be carried out as principal, secondary or ancillary activities in other sections of NACE.\n\nThe distinction between wholesale (division 46) and retail sale (division 47) is based on the type of customer.\n\nWholesale is the resale of new and used goods to retailers, business-to-business trade (for example, to industrial, commercial, institutional or professional users) or other wholesalers, or it involves acting as an agent or broker in buying merchandise for, or selling merchandise to, such persons or companies. The principal types of businesses included are merchant wholesalers, in other words, wholesalers who take title to the goods they sell, such as wholesale merchants or jobbers, industrial distributors, exporters, importers, and cooperative buying associations, sales branches and sales offices (but not retail stores) that are maintained by manufacturing or mining units apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products and that do not merely take orders to be filled by direct shipments from the plants or mines. Also included are merchandise and commodity brokers, commission merchants, agents, assemblers and buyers. If the wholesaler does not assume ownership of the goods the wholesaler trades, the wholesaler is classified in group 46.1. If the wholesaler assumes ownership of the goods, even if the wholesaler is acting on behalf of a third party, the wholesaler is classified in groups 46.2 to 46.9.\n\nWholesalers frequently physically assemble, sort and grade goods in large lots, break bulk, repack and redistribute in smaller lots (for example, for pharmaceuticals); store, refrigerate, deliver and install goods, engage in sales promotion for their customers and label design.\n\nRetailing is the resale of new and used goods to final consumers for personal or household consumption or use, whatever the channel, in shops, department stores, stalls, mail order houses, door-to-door salespersons, hawkers, consumer cooperatives, auction houses, and so on. It includes the sale of goods via showrooms (where the exposed goods can be bought), via ephemeral points of sale (for example, pop-up stores) as well as in automated retail shops.\n\nMost retailers take title to the goods they sell, but some act as agents for a principal and sell either on consignment or on a commission basis. If the retailer does not assume ownership of the goods the retailer trades, the retailer is classified in group 47.9. If the retailer assumes ownership of the goods, even if the retailer is acting on behalf of a third party, the retailer is classified in groups 47.1 to 47.8.\n\nNACE does not make any distinction at group and class level between in-store and online retail sale. Most of the retail sale activities operate both in-store and online (as well other distribution channels) and it is difficult to differentiate between the two distribution/sales channels based on the primary sales method. The share of in-store and online sales can vary over time affecting the stability of the classification. The main classification criteria for retail sale in NACE is based on what is sold and not the sales channel.\n\nRetailing via mail order or the internet is classified according to the type of goods sold.\n\nThe distinction between wholesale and retail sale is not based on the quantity of goods sold, as wholesale may be made on a unit basis, just as retail sales may be made on a bulk basis. Instead, the primary distinction between wholesale and retail sale is the type of customer. Wholesale usually involves business customers while retail usually involves final customers, such as households. If a trader sells to both business and final customers without distinction and it is practically impossible to distinguish the majority type of customers, then it is recommended to treat the seller as a retailer.\n\nBlending of beverages to be provided by the manufacturer or by a contractor is classified in manufacturing (section C). If carried out as a usual operation (or manipulation) associated with trade, it is considered as an ancillary activity and integrated in section G.\nThis section also includes:\n- transit trade activities consisting of buying commodities, moving them from one customs territory to another. Transit trade represents a triangular transaction in which the transit trader carries out export and import transactions between two or more different countries outside their own economic territory. The transit trader owns the commodity during its transport (different to intermediaries that do not take ownership of the intermediated goods)\n- specialised and non-specialised intermediation service activities for retail sale, see 47.9\n- sale of food and beverages via vending machines or automated points of sale\nThis section excludes:\n- trade of electricity, see 35.15\n- trade of gaseous fuels for energy supply through mains, see 35.23\n- the commerce of digital goods, streaming and downloading of content on digital platforms (e.g. e-books, audio), see section J\n- activities of resellers of prepaid calling cards and services, see 61.20\n- repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, see division 95\n- cooperative associations; these are classified to their predominant activity"],"G46":["Wholesale trade","This division includes wholesale of physical goods on own account or on a fee or contract basis (commission trade) related to domestic (national) wholesale as well as international wholesale (import/export), including on the internet.\n\nWholesale on own account means owning the goods traded until the ownership is transferred to the buyer. In the case of transit trade, the goods are commissioned by a buyer, but the agent owns the goods while they are in transit. However, both cases are classified the same way (groups 46.2 to 46.9).\n\nThis division includes wholesale on a fee or contract basis (group 46.1), specialised wholesale (groups 46.2 to 46.8) and non-specialised wholesale (group 46.9); class 46.39 is an exception as it includes non-specialised wholesale of food, beverages and tobacco.\n\nThe rules for defining specialised and non-specialised
