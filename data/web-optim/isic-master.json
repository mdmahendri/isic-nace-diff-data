The materials, substances, or components undergoing transformation are either raw materials or products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration, renovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be manufacturing.\nThe output of a manufacturing process may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilisation or consumption, or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for further manufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the input used in the primary production of aluminium; primary aluminium is the input to aluminium wire drawing; and aluminium wire is the input for the manufacture of fabricated wire products.\nThis section includes factoryless goods producers (FGPs) that completely outsources the transformation process but still controls the production process and supplies critical intellectual property inputs, regardless of whether the principal owns the material inputs or not. The FGPs are classified in the same class where they would have been classified if they carried out the manufacturing process themselves. However, this section excludes units that completely outsources the transformation process but neither controls the production process, nor supplies the critical intellectual property inputs, nor owns the material inputs. These units are in fact buying the completed goods from the manufacturer with the intention to re-sell them. Such an activity is classified in section G (Wholesale and retail trade), specifically according to the type of sale and the specific type of goods being sold.\nManufacture of specialised components and parts of, and accessories and attachments to, machinery and equipment is, as a general rule, classified in the same class as the manufacture of the machinery and equipment for which the parts and accessories are intended. Manufacture of unspecialised components and parts of machinery and equipment, e.g. engines, pistons, electric motors, electrical assemblies, valves, gears, roller bearings, is classified in the appropriate class of manufacturing, without regard to the machinery and equipment in which these items may be included. \nMaking specialised components and accessories by moulding or extruding plastics materials is usually included in group 222.\nAssembly of the component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing. This includes the assembly of manufactured products from either self-produced or purchased components. \nThe recovery of waste, i.e. the processing of waste into secondary_x0002_ raw materials is classified in group 383 (Materials and other waste recovery). While this may involve physical, chemical or biological transformations, this is not considered to be a part of manufacturing. The primary purpose of these activities is considered to be the treatment or processing of waste and they are therefore classified in Section E (Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities). However, the manufacture of new products from secondary raw materials is classified in manufacturing, even if these processes use waste as an input. For example, the production of silver from film waste is considered to be a manufacturing process.\nSpecialised maintenance and repair of industrial, commercial and similar machinery and equipment is, in general, classified in division 33 (Repair, maintenance and installation of machinery and equipment).\nHowever, the repair and maintenance of computers, personal and household goods and motor vehicles and motorcycles is classified in division 95 (Repair and maintenance of computers, personal and household goods, and motor vehicles and motorcycles).\nThe installation of industrial machinery and equipment, when carried out as a specialised activity, is classified in class 3320. \nMaintenance, repair and installation of equipment that forms an integral part of buildings or similar structures, such as maintenance, repair and installation of escalators or of air-conditioning systems, is classified as construction in section F (Construction), if carried out at the construction site. \n\nAs a general rule, the activities in the manufacturing section involve the transformation of materials into new products, and the repair and installation of machinery and equipment. The output is either a new product or a product that has gone through factory rebuilding and remanufacturing.  As clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in ISIC:_x000D_- fresh fish processing (oyster shucking, fish filleting), not done on a fishing boat (see 1020)_x000D_- milk pasteurising and bottling (see 1050)_x000D_- leather converting (see 1511)_x000D_- wood preserving (see 1629)_x000D_- printing and related activities (see 181)_x000D_- tyre retreading (see 2211)_x000D_- ready-mixed concrete production (see 2395)_x000D_- electroplating, plating, and metal heat treating (see 2592)_x000D_- rebuilding or remanufacture of machinery (e.g. automobile engines, see 2910)_x000D_- refilling or recharging of fire extinguishers_x000D_- manufacture and deliverance of structures and prefabricated buildings with minimal on-site construction work_x000D_\nConversely, there are activities that, although sometimes involving transformation processes, are _x000D_classified in other sections of ISIC; in other words, they are not considered as manufacturing.

Goods are physical, produced objects for which a demand exists, over which ownership rights can be established and whose ownership can be transferred from one unit to another by engaging in transactions on markets.\nWholesaling and retailing are the final steps in the distribution of merchandise. For this purpose, ancillary activities () are carried out, which is considered to include a number of usual operations (or manipulations) associated with trade, without transforming the goods. These operations (or manipulations) include, for example, sorting, grading and assembling of goods, mixing of goods (e.g. sand), bottling (with or without preceding bottle cleaning), packaging, breaking bulk and repacking for distribution in smaller lots, storage (whether or not frozen or chilled). If not carried out as usual operations (or manipulations) associated with trade, the mentioned activities can be carried out as principal, secondary or ancillary activities in other sections of ISIC.\nWholesale is the resale of new and used goods to retailers, business-to-business trade, such as to industrial, commercial, institutional or professional users, or resale to other wholesalers, or involves acting as an agent or broker in buying merchandise for, or selling merchandise to, such persons or companies. The principal types of businesses included are merchant wholesalers, i.e. wholesalers who take title to the goods they sell, such as wholesale merchants or jobbers, industrial distributors, exporters, importers, and cooperative buying associations, sales branches and sales offices (but not retail stores) that are maintained by manufacturing or mining units apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products and that do not merely take orders to be filled by direct shipments from the plants or mines. Also included are intermediation service activities, such as the activities of merchandise and commodity brokers, commission merchants and agents and assemblers, cooperative associations primarily engaged in the marketing of farm products. If the wholesaler does not assume ownership of the goods he trades, he must be classified in group 461. If the wholesaler assumes ownership of the goods, even if he is acting on behalf of a third party, he must be classified in groups 462-469.\nWholesalers frequently physically assemble, sort and grade goods in large lots, break bulk, repack and redistribute in smaller lots, for example pharmaceuticals; store, refrigerate, deliver and install goods, engage in sales promotion for their customers and label design.\nRetailing is the resale of new and used goods to the general public for personal or household consumption or utilisation, whatever the channel, in shops, department stores, stalls, mail-order houses, door-to-door sales persons, hawkers, consumer cooperatives, auction houses etc. It includes the sale of goods via showroom (where the exposed goods can be bought), via ephemeral points of sale (e.g. pop up stores) as well as in automated retail shops. \n\nMost retailers take title to the goods they sell, but some act as agents for a principal and sell either on consignment or on a commission basis.\nRetailing via mail order or internet is classified according to the type of goods sold.\nThe distinction between wholesale and retail is not based on the quantity of goods sold, as wholesale sales may be made on a unit basis, just as retail sales may be made on a bulk basis. Instead, the primary distinction between wholesale and retail is the type of customer. Wholesale usually involves business as customers, and retail trade usually sell to individual customers. If a trader sells to both business and household customers without distinction, and it is practically impossible to distinguish the majority type of customers, then it is recommended to treat the seller as a retailer.\nThis section also includes: \n- transit trade activities consisting of buying commodities, moving them from one customs territory to another or from one point to another in the same customs territory and finally selling them. Transit trade represents a triangular transaction in which the transit trader carries out export and import transactions between two or more different countries outside his own economic territory.
