For each mapping, indicate:\\n1. The ISIC code(s) and NACE code(s) that correspond\\n2. Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)\\n3. Type of match (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many)\\n\\nReturn the results in a structured JSON format like:\\n{\\n  \"mappings\": [\\n    {\\n      \"isic_codes\": [\"A\"],\\n      \"nace_codes\": [\"A\"],\\n      \"confidence\": \"High\",\\n      \"match_type\": \"one-to-one\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"isic_codes\": [\"01\"],\\n      \"nace_codes\": [\"01.11\", \"01.12\"],\\n      \"confidence\": \"High\",\\n      \"match_type\": \"one-to-many\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"unmatched_codes\": {\\n    \"isic\": [\"05\", \"10\", \"9000\"],\\n    \"nace\": [\"05\", \"90.11\"]\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nImportant matching principles:\\n1. Check hierarchical relationships (ISIC sections/divisions vs NACE sections/divisions)\\n2. Look for semantic similarity in titles\\n3. Consider cross-references between systems\\n4. Note that NACE is based on ISIC but has more granular European adaptations\\n'"

      "### Key Observations and Rationale:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **High Confidence Matches:** The vast majority of codes are direct, one-to-one matches with identical or nearly identical titles. The hierarchical structure (Sections, Divisions, Groups, Classes) aligns perfectly.\n",
      "2.  **Notable Exceptions (Medium Confidence):**\n",
      "    *   **ISIC 0141 (Raising of cattle and buffaloes)** maps to **NACE 01.41 (Raising of dairy cattle)** and **01.42 (Raising of other cattle and buffaloes)**. NACE splits this category, so it's a one-to-many match. The semantic coverage is complete, but the granularity differs.\n",
      "    *   **ISIC 081/0810 (Quarrying of stone, sand and clay)** maps to the broader **NACE 08.1**. NACE provides more detail with **08.11** and **08.12**. This is a one-to-many match where the ISIC code is less granular.\n",
      "3.  **Consolidation (High Confidence):**\n",
      "    *   **ISIC 0163 (Post-harvest crop activities)** and **0164 (Seed processing for propagation)** are consolidated into a single **NACE 01.63 (Post-harvest crop activities and seed processing for propagation)**. This is a clear many-to-one match.\n",
      "4.  **Unmatched NACE Codes:** **NACE 08.11** and **08.12** are more detailed sub-categories of the ISIC 081 group. They are listed as unmatched because there is no single, equally granular ISIC code to map them to individually. They are correctly covered by the mapping to the parent code `08.1`.\n",
      "5.  **Code Format:** ISIC codes in the 4th digit (e.g., `0130`) often represent the same activity as the 3-digit group (e.g., `013`). In these cases, both are mapped to the corresponding NACE group and class for completeness. NACE uses a consistent decimal system (e.g., `01.30`).\n",
      "\n",
      "This mapping for Sections A and B is highly reliable due to the structural and semantic alignment between the two systems.\n"
